# Concepts

List of concepts defined by the library.

Each concept is a description of a set of operations that a type must support in order to be considered as meeting the requirements of the concept. The concept name is a succinct way of specifying the constraints on type parameters passed to C++ templates. Note that you need document only the new concepts you create. Those that are included from the Boost Concept Check headers are already documented.
