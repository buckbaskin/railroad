# Types

List of C++ types defined by the library.

A type used by the library. A type may be a C++ template, class or structure. If it is a template, there are no type parameters so that section can be dropped. If its a class, member functions will be documented in the section "New Valid Expressions". This is somewhat different than the traditional way of documenting class member functions and types. The advantage is that is more compatible with the documentation of template types. In any case, the actual class header is available for reference.
